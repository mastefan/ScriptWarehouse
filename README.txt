ScriptWarehouse Repository

Web address: https://github.com/mastefan/ScriptWarehouse

This is a central repository where I will store and edit scripts and functions 
that I am using in my M.ES. thesis project.

Creating an online repository for these scripts is intended to allow me to 
have a cloud access point for these scripts, to easily share these with 
others, and to have a convenient and central backup location.
